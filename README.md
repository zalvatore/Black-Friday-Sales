## Project Description
TallMart wants to determine how to approach their sales strategy in anticipation of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, the biggest sales event of the United States. TallMart has accumulated data on their customer base, and wants to understand their target market and potential products to markdown for this event.

## Purpose
This study aims to develop accurate and reliable predictive models that enable us to estimate the purchase amount for a retail store, given the sales transactions of the store. The provided data includes information about the user, the products, the shoppers age and occupation, their city and marital status, among the other factors. 

## Background
TallMart was previously known as a large brick and mortar store, but since the COVID-19 pandemic, customers have shifted from preferring in-person shopping to online. With the holiday season coming up, TallMart wants to maintain their current customer base and capitalize upon online shopping marketing strategies. Black Friday is one of the largest retail mega-sale events, and oftentimes the most profitable quarters for retail companies. TallMart has requested that the data collected from their customers be analyzed to create targeted marketing campaigns that will influence buying decisions during the holiday season.

## Current Situation
The data set contains half a million observations, within the data set there are approximately 6,000 users and 4,000 products. This would indicate multiple records per user and single observations by product. With the user and product information conjunction with the other variables a model will be developed to predict purchase amount by retail store and profile customer features that influence and consumer behavior. Secondary models will be designed to understand market basket behavior, find the relationship between products which will produce insight to the marketing department for targeted marketing and add on purchasing.

## Conclusion
This study will enable TallMart to further take advantage of the Black Friday sales via wisely investing upon its online shopping marketing strategies. In particular, by developing an accurate and robust predictive model, the company will be able to estimate the purchase amount customized for each shopper profile, allowing the company to target the correct shoppers with different forms of online marketing strategies. Furthermore, the outcome of the study will help the company better manage its inventory of multiple types of bricks and mortars as well as giving it an opportunity to better plan for the deliveries and shipments.
